				<h2>What is software testing? <small>1/2</small></h2>
				<p>Software testing is a broad term but in general is a process which validate that a software program, application or product:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">Meets the business and technical requirements that guided it’s design and development</li>
					<li class="fragment">Has no bugs/defects/errors</li>
					<li class="fragment">Works as expected</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>What is software testing? <small>2/2</small></h2>
				<p>From technical point of view software testing evaluate a software item (i.e. class, class method or function) to detect
					differences between given input and expected output.</p>
				<p class="fragment">Furthermore testing assess the quality of the product.</p>
				<p class="fragment">Testing should be done during the software development process.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Who does software testing?&nbsp;<small>1/2</small></h2>
				<p>In the IT industry, large companies have a team with responsibilities to evaluate the developed software in context of
					the given requirements. In most cases, the following professionals are involved in testing a system within their respective
					capacities:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">Software Tester</li>
					<li class="fragment">Software Developer</li>
					<li class="fragment">Project Lead/Manager</li>
					<li class="fragment">End User</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Who does software testing?&nbsp;<small>2/2</small></h2>
				<p>In the incremental software development model (for instance in Scrum), testing is performed at the end of every sprint/iteration
					and the whole application is tested at the end.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Types of software testing.</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Manual testing
						<small class="fragment">In nutshell manual testing means testing without any automated tools or any scripts. 
							Tester/developer takes over the role of an end-user and tests the software to identify any unexpected behaviour or bug.</small>
					</li>
					<li>
						Automate testing
						<small class="fragment">
							This is a process when a user write scripts or use test framework / library to test the product. 
							This is just an automation of manual testing. 
							This kind of testing is used to re-run the test scenarios/ test suits for example whenever user saves his code or push commits to the repository.
						</small>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Levels of software testing.</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Functional testing
						<small>
							This is a black-box testing which based on the specifications of the software that is to be tested. <br>
						</small>
					</li>
					<li>
						Non-functional testing
						<small>
							This kind of testing involves testing a software from the requirements which are nonfunctional in nature, 
							but important such as performance (load testing and stress testing), security or user interface.
						</small>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Functional testing <small>1/2</small></h2>
				<p>We can distinguish several types of functional tests:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Unit testing
						<small class="fragment">
							The goal of unit testing is to isolate each part of the program and show that individual 
							parts are correct in terms of requirements and functionality.
						</small>
					</li>
					<li>
						Integration testing / E2E
						<small class="fragment">
							Integration testing is defined as the testing of combined parts of an application to determine if they function correctly. 
							There are two approaches: <br> 
							<ul>
								<li>Bottom-up integration – unit tests are followed by higher level tests</li>
								<li>Top-down integration – works other way around</li>
							</ul>
							In this group we can also distinguish End-to-end testing which  ensure that software works as expected from user’s perpective.
						</small>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Functional testing <small>2/2</small></h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						System testing
						<small class="fragment">
							Once all the components are integrated, the application as a whole is tested rigorously
							to see that it meets the specified Quality Standards.
						</small>
					</li>
					<li>
						Regression testing
						<small class="fragment">
							The intent of regression testing is to ensure that a change, such as a bug fix 
							should not result in another fault being uncovered in the application.
						</small>
					</li>
					<li>
						Acceptance testing
						<small class="fragment">
							This is arguably the most important type of testing, as it is conducted by the Quality Assurance Team 
							who will assess whether the application meets the intended specifications and satisfies the client’s requirements.
						</small>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>TDD in software testing <small>1/3</small></h2>
				<p>Test-driven development is a programming methodology that complement test-first approach of Extreme Programming in which
					developers write tests before implementing a feature or a unit.
				</p>

				<h2>TDD in software testing <small>2/3</small></h2>
				<p>TDD is a process that consists of three phases:</p>
				<img src="/img/tdd.png" alt="tdd life cycle" class="fragment">
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>TDD in software testing <small>3/3</small></h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Write a failing test
						<small class="fragment">
							Write a test that invokes your logic and assert that the correct behaviour is produced.
							<ul>
								<li>In a unit test, this would be asserting the return value of a function or verifying 
									that a mocked dependency was called as expected</li>
								<li>In a functional test, this would be ensuring that a UI or an API behaves predictably across a number of actions</li>
							</ul>
						</small>
					</li>
					<li>
						Make the test pass
						<small class="fragment">
							Implement the minimum amount of code that results in the test passing, and ensure that all other tests continue to pass
						</small>
					</li>
					<li>
						Refactor the implementation
						<small class="fragment">
							Update or rewrite the implementation, without breaking any public contracts, to improve 
							its quality without breaking the new and existing tests
						</small>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Demo</h2>

				<h2>Summary</h2>

							the client.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Diagnosing and fixing errors identified during proper testing should not be interpreted as a time-consuming process
